FlindersRedbox-rif2website
=========================

Purpose
-------
"ReDBox is a metadata registry application for describing research data.
The Mint is an name-authority and vocabulary service that complements ReDBox."
See http://www.redboxresearchdata.com.au/. The purpose of this script is
to read ReDBox and Mint RIF-CS (XML) via a network connection and generate a
static web page for each registryObject element (ie. RIF-CS record). Each
static web page is generated by extracting XML information from rules
specified in a file.

Notes
-----
- Has been tested and designed for use on ReDBox and Mint dev-handle build.
- In order for handles to point to these pages, each data source template
  (eg. Mint home/harvest/Parties_People.json) should have it's urlTemplate like:
  > "urlTemplate": "http://MY_STATIC_PAGES_VHOST/MY_PATH/[[OID]].html",

  At the time of writing, all Mint urlTemplates are:
  > "urlTemplate": "http://MY_STATIC_PAGES_VHOST/md/m/[[OID]].html",

  and ReDBox urlTemplate (in home/harvest/workflows/dataset.json) is:
  > "urlTemplate": "http://MY_STATIC_PAGES_VHOST/md/r/[[OID]].html",
- Because the source information is the ReDBox-Mint RIF-CS portals, hence
  available on a network, this script (and so the destination website)
  can be on a host other than ReDBox or Mint servers.

Application environment
-----------------------
Read the INSTALL file.

Installation
------------
Read the INSTALL file.

Features
--------
- Use the RIF-CS key to lookup the Facinator OID:
  * with redirect 1 level deep
- If there is more than one OAI-PMH page of records, iterate through all pages by using the resumption token
- Use the following config files (with hash elements which can be overwritten):
  * main (containing RIFCS URL, target root dir, target html-template, user-agent)
  * multiple rule-files according to user's preference Eg. perhaps 1 per record type (eg. collection, party) and subtype (eg. dataset, person)
- log file (eg. errors, warnings)
- HtmlHelper class
- Allow one invocation for Mint and another for Redbox.
- Using a replacement token for xpath PRIMARY RECORD TYPE so the user
  can reference other rulesets. Eg ActivityProjectRules = PartyPersonRules
- Allow program to determine which RIF-CS records will be processed based
  which *Rules arrays exist.
- Security checks before running eval().
- Convert URLs into hyperlinks.
- Ensure shell script will run as a cronjob.
- Cope with ReDBox-Mint being offline.
- Make a handle-landing page for each retired record.
- Make a rule to show the OID.
- Make a rule to show the ANDS "Registry View" URL for record. ANDS Services say this is no longer possible since RDA Release 10.
- Make a rule to show the RDA URL for record.
- Split dest dir by redbox/mint repo; may be necessary to avoid an OID namespace clash!
- Consider creating a summary page (eg. index.html) which points to all
  static pages created by this script.
- Use common html-template for both summary page and individual pages.
- Allow selected output table rows to be highlighted (eg. with bold or italic text).
- Ruby source code produces rdoc documentation.
- Rules have been written for record types:
  * party-person
  * activity-project
  * collection-* (but not complete)

  No rules have been written for service-* 

Todo
----
- Consider untarring images/css in ruby via config file (perhaps using minitar gem).
- Consider instructing the web browser not to cache the page.
