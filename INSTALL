- GNU bash, version 4.1.2(1)-release (x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu)
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.3 (Santiago)
- 2.6.32-279.11.1.el6.x86_64 #1 SMP Sat Sep 22 07:10:26 EDT 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
- ReDBox v1.5.1 & 1.6.1; https://github.com/redbox-mint/redbox-build-dev-handle/tree/redbox-handle-curation-demo-1.5.1
- Mint v1.5.1 & 1.6.1; https://github.com/redbox-mint/mint-build-dev-handle/tree/mint-handle-curation-demo-1.5.1

If you cannot install the above ruby version to your Unix/Linux
operating system from source or via your normal package management 
system, consider using Ruby Version Manager at https://rvm.io.

This software has not been designed to run under the Microsoft
Windows operating system, it may be feasible under 2 scenarios.
 - Install Cygwin (see http://www.cygwin.com) then run ruby and bash scripts under that environment.
 - Install Ruby 1.8.7 (I understand pik at https://github.com/vertiginous/pik may be useful to install
   a particular version) then rewrite shell scripts in some Windows language (eg. as .BAT scripts)


2. INSTALLATION


2.1 WARNING

The rif2website_wrap.sh script uses rsync with the --delete option to
synchronise directories. This is a potentially hazardous command!
The man page says:

  This tells rsync to delete extraneous files from the receiving side
  (ones that aren't on the sending side)...  This option can be dangerous
  if used incorrectly!  It is a very good idea to first try a run using
  the --dry-run option (-n) to see what files are going to be deleted.

In the rif2website_wrap.sh script, the --dry-run option can be added
to the RSYNC_OPTS variable.


2.2 ASSUMPTIONS

 - That you have a basic understanding of Linux/Unix, Ruby and bash, sh or
   ksh shell scripts.
 - That you are using a Linux, Unix or Unix-like environment similar to that
   described under APPLICATION ENVIRONMENT.
 - rsync (http://rsync.samba.org/) has been installed.
 - You have ReDBox or Mint or both web apps installed.
 - Published metadata from the above apps result in Handle.net persistent identifiers.
 - That the user who runs this program has permission to read from the ReDBox
   and Mint OAI-PMH RIF-CS URLs. This usually means that there are no firewall
   rules or Apache access controls preventing access to those URLs from the IP
   address upon which this program is running.
 - That the user who runs this program has permission to write files (static web
   pages) into the Apache (or other web server) web root directory.


2.3 INSTRUCTIONS

 - Download from github
 - Checkout latest version/tag
 - Update config for your site
   * BIN_DIR in the script rif2website.sh
   * BIN_DIR, IMAGES_CSS_TARBALL, HOST, VHOST, WWW_PARENT
     in the script rif2website_wrap.sh
   * create an html template for:
     - your individual metadata web page (use the demo template initially)
     - your summary web page (use the demo template initially)
   * values for the following Config[] keys in etc/conf_main.rb:
     - :html_template_filename
     - :html_summary_template_filename
     - :ands_rda_url_prefix
     - 2x :dest_root_dir
     - 2x :url_str_rifcs (if this script is being run on a different host than the ReDBox-Mint server)
 - If required update rules for your site (however the default rules will probably be suitable)


3. EXAMPLES


3.1 SAMPLE INSTALLATION USING A TEMPLATE WITHOUT EXTERNAL CSS

The purpose of this sample is to:
 - show some of the important configuration options
 - use a very simple html template to demonstrate TAG substitution
 - have little concern regarding the prettiness of resulting web pages


Scenario:

 - A Handle.net server has been installed and is available for use by ReDBox and Mint.
 - ReDBox and Mint have been installed and configured to create a handle during curation.
 - The appropriate ReDBox and Mint data source json files have been configured to point
   to a URL representing a static web page via the ReDBox-Mint OID. For ReDBox metadata, use:
     "urlTemplate": "http://MY_VHOST/md/r/[[OID]].html",
   For Mint metadata, use:
     "urlTemplate": "http://MY_VHOST/md/m/[[OID]].html",
   Where:
   * MY_VHOST = andsdevpub.MY_DOMAIN
   * "md/r" folder is for storage of ReDBox metadata web pages
   * "md/m" folder is for storage of Mint metadata web pages
   * "[[OID]]" is the ReDBox-Mint template-string and will be replaced with
     the record's actual OID by ReDBox-Mint during curation
 - Assumes you have at least one published record in ReDBox and at least one
   published record in Mint, hence the records are visible locally (eg. via wget) at:
     http://localhost:9000/redbox/published/feed/oai?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=rif
     http://localhost:9001/mint/published/feed/oai?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=rif
   or perhaps via a web browser at:
     https://REDBOX_VHOST/redbox/published/feed/oai?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=rif
     https://MINT_VHOST/mint/published/feed/oai?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=rif
 - The filesystem path to each of the above web directories are:
     /var/www/andsdevpub/md/r
   and:
     /var/www/andsdevpub/md/m
   respectively.
 - This application to be installed in $HOME/opt/rif2website of an unprivileged user.
 - The above user has permission to write to /var/www/andsdevpub/md/r
   and /var/www/andsdevpub/md/m.
 - This application will be installed on the same host as the ReDBox-Mint server.
 - The above user has permission to read from ReDBox-Mint OAI-PMH RIF-CS portals at:
     http://localhost:9000/redbox/published/feed/oai
     http://localhost:9001/mint/published/feed/oai
 - Static pages will point to the harvested versions of the record in
   the RDA (Research Data Australia) Demo environment.


Instructions:

mkdir ~/opt
git clone https://github.com/grantj-re3/FlindersRedbox-rif2website.git ~/opt/rif2website
cd ~/opt/rif2website

# If you want a particular version
git tag # List tagged releases
git checkout ... # Checkout the desired release

# Read files INSTALL LICENSE README*

# Symlink (or copy or rename) the etc_sample_nocss directory so that the contents
# appears to be in the etc directory.
# In addition to configuration and rules files, this directory contains:
# - a very simple html template
# - an image/CSS tarball which is empty
ln -s etc_sample_nocss etc

# Update config for your site

In rif2website.sh:
 - confirm BIN_DIR has the value: $HOME/opt/rif2website

In script rif2website_wrap.sh:
 - confirm BIN_DIR=$HOME/opt/rif2website
 - confirm WEB_APP_LIST="mint redbox"
 - confirm IMAGES_CSS_TARBALL=$HOME/opt/rif2website/etc/images_css.tar.gz
 - confirm HOST=`hostname -s`
 - confirm VHOST="${HOST}pub"
 - confirm WWW_PARENT=/var/www/$VHOST/md
 - consider adding the --dry-run option to RSYNC_OPTS (see warning above)

Confirm html template etc/metadata_record.tpl.html exists.

In etc/conf_main.rb:
 - In the "Config" hash, confirm the following key-value assignments:
     :html_template_filename => "#{ENV['HOME']}/opt/rif2website/etc/metadata_record.tpl.html",
     :html_summary_template_filename => "#{ENV['HOME']}/opt/rif2website/etc/metadata_record.tpl.html",
     :ands_rda_url_prefix => 'http://demo.ands.org.au/view/',

 - In the "ConfigMint" hash, confirm the following key-value assignments:
     :dest_root_dir => '/var/www/andsdevpub/md/m_temp',
     :url_str_rifcs => 'http://localhost:9001/mint/published/feed/oai',

 - In the "ConfigRedbox" hash, confirm the following key-value assignments:
     :dest_root_dir => '/var/www/andsdevpub/md/r_temp',
     :url_str_rifcs => 'http://localhost:9000/redbox/published/feed/oai',

It is important that the following 2 variables are identical:
 - INTERMED_WEBSITE_DIR (derived from WWW_PARENT) in each iteration of
   the loop in script rif2website_wrap.sh
 - ConfigMint[:dest_root_dir ] for Mint; ConfigRedbox[:dest_root_dir]
   for ReDBox in etc/conf_main.rb

# Run the program
  bin/rif2website_wrap.sh --help
  bin/rif2website_wrap.sh --full-harvest

Examine the results:
 - Check for errors or issues displayed by the program output (stdout).
 - Check for errors or issues in the log file RifToWebsite.log.
 - If there are no errors or issues, check that static web page files
   exist at:
     /var/www/andsdevpub/md/r/index.html
     /var/www/andsdevpub/md/r/123456789.html  # Assumes 123456789 is an OID of a published ReDBox record
     /var/www/andsdevpub/md/m/index.html
     /var/www/andsdevpub/md/m/987654321.html  # Assumes 987654321 is an OID of a published Mint record
 - Check that the content of the files seems reasonable. All
   html-commented-tags of the form <!-- [[TAG_...]] --> should 
   have been replaced with RIF-CS or other contents, so should 
   not exist in the above website .html files.
 - If the files exist and have reasonable content, check that they
   are available to the public via a web broswer at URLs:
     http://MY_VHOST/md/r/index.html
     http://MY_VHOST/md/r/123456789.html  # Assumes 123456789 is an OID of a published ReDBox record
     http://MY_VHOST/md/m/index.html
     http://MY_VHOST/md/m/987654321.html  # Assumes 987654321 is an OID of a published Mint record
 - Once all is configured and running as desired, set up a cron job
   as given in this Examples section.
 - Celebrate!

3.2 SAMPLE INSTALLATION USING A TEMPLATE WITH EXTERNAL CSS

The purpose of this sample is to:
 - show the same important configuration options as shown above
 - use a more complicated html template (but with TAG substitution identical to the above)
 - pay more attention to creating pretty web pages

Scenario:
Identical to the above scenario.

Instructions:
Identical to the above instructions with the following exceptions.

# Symlink (or copy or rename) the etc_sample_css directory so that the contents
# appears to be in the etc directory.
# In addition to configuration and rules files, this directory contains:
# - an html template (obtained from a free CSS zip file)
# - an image/CSS tarball (of which the contents was obtained from the same zip file)
ln -s etc_sample_css etc

# Symlink (or copy or rename) the configuration and rules files.
cd etc_sample_css
ln -s ../etc_sample_nocss/conf_main.rb .
ln -s ../etc_sample_nocss/rules_01.rb .
cd ..


3.3 CRON JOB EXAMPLE

After installing and testing this app (see the sample installation documentation above)
you can run a scheduled job (cron job) with a configuration similar to that below.

  # Run job every hour from 8:20-18:20 Mon-Fri. Write stdout/stderr to a log file.
  20 8-18 * * 1-5 $HOME/opt/rif2website/bin/rif2website_wrap.sh --full-harvest >> $HOME/opt/rif2website/log/rif2website_wrap.log 2>&1

After the first successful full harvest, you may choose to perform incremental harvests
(ie. from a recent datestamp) instead of full harvests.


3.4 OPERATIONAL NOTES

1) Ideally, incremental harvests are performed from the last
   successful harvest. However currently we do not use success to
   determine the OAI-PMH harvest from-date. Instead we use the
   variable OAI_HOURS_AGO (in bin/rif2website_wrap.sh) to set the
   harvest from-date. Eg. If OAI_HOURS_AGO=72, the script will
   harvest any ReDBox-Mint records which have been created or have
   changed in the past 3 days (measured from the time the script is run).

2) To minimise internet traffic (and so improve performance by a massive
   amount) OID information is cached in the rif2website/var directory.
   If at some point you wish to refresh all OID information from the
   internet, you may safely delete the cache files oid.mint.* and
   oid.redbox.*. These files are not intended to be manually edited.

3) For incremental harvests, summary information for md/r/index.html
   and md/m/index.html are stored in the rif2website/var directory.
   If the summary_status.redbox.* or summary_status.mint.* files
   are deleted, the index.html files will probably be missing links
   to some of the records. They can be rebuilt by performing a
   full harvest. These files are not intended to be manually edited.

3.5 CUSTOMISING YOUR WEB PAGE CONTENT

Web pages are created by substituting special text within
an html template (eg. etc/metadata_record.tpl.html) with
other text derived from the program (eg. RIF-CS content).

The text which will be replaced consists of html-commented-tags
such as:
  <!-- [[TAG_PAGE_TITLE]] -->

This html-commented-tag might be replaced with text such as:
  "Research metadata record"

To change substitution text associated with the following tags:
 - TAG_PAGE_TITLE
 - TAG_PAGE_HEADING
 - TAG_LAST_UPDATED

then follow the guidelines below.

1) For individual web pages (each describing an individual RIF-CS record) update:
   File:   outwebpage.rb
   Class:  OutWebPage
   Method: to_s_html()
   Hash:   tpl_tag_repl_strs

2) For the summary (index.html) page, update:
   File:   rif2website.rb
   Class:  RifToWebsite
   Method: self.to_s_html()
   Hash:   tpl_tag_repl_strs

Date-time formatting is performed using the strftime() method (with Ruby
documentation at http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.8.7/Time.html#method-i-strftime).
The Ruby timezone is taken from either the operating system or the shell
TZ environment variable.

Changing substitution text for other tags is beyond the scope of
this document.


3.6 CUSTOMISING YOUR WEB PAGE BRANDING

To create a page which has branding suitable for your organisation, you need to:

1) Create (or copy) an html page (ie. the html template) suitable for storing 
   metadata in a table. The template shall be placed in the application's "etc"
   directory. The resulting webpages shall reside in a configurable filesystem 
   location (eg. the /var/www/andsdevpub/md/m directory in the Mint examples above).

2) Any image and CSS files required for the template are:
   - expected to be grouped into a small number of directories 
   - compressed into a tarball (eg. etc/images_css.tar.gz)
   - expected to be untarred into the same configurable filesystem location
     (eg. the /var/www/andsdevpub/md/m directory in the Mint examples above)

   If your html template points to images/CSS at a common URL for your whole
   institution, then you do not need to store and untar any image/CSS files.
   However, it is recommended to keep image/CSS files under the control of
   the same person/group who supports this program and template.

3) Appropriately place five html-commented-tags within the template. (See
   the sample templates, etc/metadata_record.tpl.html).

Notes:
 - HTML template files are viewable via your web browser (with or without
   html-commented-tags added) and have a .html file extension to assist with viewing.
 - Currently there is no feature to display odd and even lines of table
   content using different styles.
